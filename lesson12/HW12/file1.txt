Hi, everyone! My name is Olga, and I’m graduating from school this year. As for many teenagers, the choice of future career is a real challenge for me.
There are so many jobs, so it’s rather difficult to make the right decision. Furthermore, I’m firmly convinced that the choice of future career is essential, and I don’t want to regret it for the rest of my life.
So I have been thinking about it for a long time. I have discussed it many times with my parents and closest friends, but I’m still a bit confused.
Firstly, I had a wish to do something I am keen on. I suppose turning your hobby into your future job is a great way one can become a successful specialist.
I think I’m not bad at writing stories. I absolutely adore it! I can spend evenings thinking about the characters and the plot of my stories. I’m also fond of making illustrations to them. In addition, all the process of story making is very enjoyable to me. That’s why I firmly believe that working as a writer is the best variant for me.
The only problem is that my parents totally disagree with me. They say it’s not the right way to make money and it’s just my childish dream. They think I must be realistic and force me to become a programmer.
I love computers and I spend quite a lot of time sitting in front of one, but programming is a completely different thing. I’m attending a programming course at the moment, so I can see it’s not something I’d really want to do.
Thus, I hope I’ll be able to make the right choice, but for now future career is still an open issue.
